										<h1>Staffing for Influenza Season</h1>
									</header>

									<h2>Context</h2>
									<p>A medical staffing agency provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals on an as-needed basis. During flu season, vulnerable populations (individuals age 65+) are particular susceptible.</p>
									
									<h2>Objective</h2>
									<p>Present insights to stakeholders to determine when to send staff, and how many to each state for the flu season of 2018.</p>
									
									<h2>Deliverable(s)</h2>
									<p>Create a Tableau Storyboard to tell the compelling tale of the data.</p>
									
									<h2>Tools Used</h2>
									<p>Microsoft Excel, and Tableau Public for Visualizations.</p>
												
									<h2>The Data</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>Influenza deaths by geography, time, age, and gender, 2009-2017. Source: CDC
										<a href="https://https://coach-courses-us.s3.amazonaws.com/public/courses/da_program/CDC_Influenza_Deaths_edited.xlsx">Data Set</a></li>
								
										<li>Population data by geography 2009-2017. Source: US Census Bureau
										<a href="https://coach-courses-us.s3.amazonaws.com/public/courses/data-immersion/A1-A2_Influenza_Project/Census_Population_transformed_202101.csv">Data Set</a></li>									
									</ul>
									<ul class="actions" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
										<li><a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/Project2_10_16914512814580/Story" class="button primary">Tableau Storyboard</a></li>
									</ul>
									
									<hr class="major" />
									
									<h2>Initial Analysis Steps</h2>
									<ol>
										<li>Create data profiles, detailing bias and source quality or integrity.</li>								
										<li>Data Integration and Transformation - Merged the two datasets on a primary key within Excel.</li>									
										<li>Calculate descriptive statistics of variables, including standard deviation and variance.</li>									
										<li>Formulate a Hypothesis test to compare if there is a significant difference among variables.</li>																		
										<li>Test for correlation between variables- Tested the correlation between death count and population over 65+.</li>
									</ol>
									
									<hr class="major" />
		
									<h2>Step 6 - Insights and Data Visualization</h2>
									<p>This map shows where high death count is concentrated and which states are affected by a high percentage of death. Still, this isn't the full story.</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="project images/flu_map.png"/></span>

									<p>In the chart below, states are sorted by population categorized by High, Medium, and Low Need. 810,000 is the mean age of the 65+ population. All states below that are labeled as Low-Need. 1,700,000 is one standard deviation above the mean and everything below that and to the mean is Medium-Need. Everything above the deviation is High-Need. In addition to population, the state's influenza deaths are also shown. This chart can clearly show the effect of death count vs death rate. New York is a perfect example.</p>

									<h2>Recommendations</h2>
									<ul> 
										<li>California, New York, Florida, Pennsylvania, Texas, Illinois, and Ohio have the most need</li>
										<li>According to previous CDC data, Influenza season varies but usually starts around week 40, increasing in severity until reaching a peak and decreasing back to around week 20.</li>
										<li>The data for staffing numbers is unavailable currently, but following projected forecasting, California and Pennsylvania will each have about 5% fewer deaths due to Influenza in 2018. Because of this, 9% of those staffing resources can move to Texas, New York, and Ohio where they have, collectively, a 9% increase in deaths forecasted.</li>
										<li>How many staff members to send can be better answered when the data is available.</li>
										<li>To monitor the effectiveness of the staffing plan, there should be an active measure of the death rate and death count for each state.</li>
										<li>If a state has an abnormally high metric, then it likely needs for staff.</li>
